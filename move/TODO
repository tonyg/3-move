Important goals (accomplish ASAP):

	add in safety fork()s in the database code, esp. in things like
	Program:compile() and the evaluator of mud expressions.

	checkpoints still a bit funny, esp. with bg checkpoints and many threads.
	checkpoints lock up real easy on the Alpha. (2 processors?)

	add in Player.last-login-time and Player.last-action-time for computing
	idle-time and login time.

	add statistics for various things:
	  - measure GC performance
	  - measure symbol-table density

	add a logging facility (format printfs prettily)
	  - this involves rewriting the DEBUG stuff so that
	    there are separate debug streams, controllable individually
	    (pref. from a separate module). Then, you see, you can
	    cat all log messages straight to stdout, formatted appropriately
	    for debug or routine log messages.

	new verb parser needed urgently

	object numbers for the UI

	generational GC

Less important goals (accomplish at leisure):

	distributed MOVE

	equal?() doesn't compare vectors at all. Add in a few more supported
	types...

	clean up #includes to avoid unnecessary interdependence

	256-limited opcodes are too limited. Escape to 16-bit?
	finalizer thread -> user level (there's no need for it yet, fortunately...)
